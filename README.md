# Important points to know:

1. This program includes implementation of features like :

- Measure the viewability of the DIV that contains the ad
- Determine viewability also by evaluating the windows focus state (tab change, window unfocused)
- Log your results either to the console or render it on the page
- Measure the portion of the ad that is visible in %
- Track clicks

2. Kindly note that this program has also included scenarios such as -

- when the viewport is increased to height 5000 and width 5000 and the advertisement is sitting anywhere in the container. The program will still calculate the percentage of the ad visibility, ad viewability flag and the clicked count of the advertisement.

3. Established basic test cases for the program

4. If you want to check the code running, simply double click the index.html file to run it.

5. If you wish to update the script file, kindly add your code, run npm run build command in your terminal, this will allow the html file to access the updated js code and run the index.html file in the browser by double clicking it.
